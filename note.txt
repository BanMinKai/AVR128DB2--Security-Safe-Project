if the sensor input is not held HIGH for a long enough interval of time, 
the system wakes up but it does not generate lock()... 
in other words, for abrupt rising and falling,  
the system wakes but does nothing else... (wake + unlock()). This electrically helps save battery life
initially this is a bug... now converted into a feature, 
which helps prevent "noise" unwanted interrupt
